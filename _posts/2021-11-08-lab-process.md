For lab activity #10, I worked on adding to my About Me page, selecting a theme for my blog, and re-organized the style of my navigation menu and blog post set-up. Because I had already pre-written the information for my first post on this blog, I opened up the saved About Me markdown file and copied it into the About Me file on my blog through VSCode. I then committed the changes and pushed and pulled it onto my main repository. Next, for my design process, I chose the theme for my blog. Because I prefer simplicity when it comes to style, I chose the Cayman theme. Finally, when it came to navigating the menu, I decided to remove the bullet points because it made the menu look more casual. Also, because it would be one of the first thing that my readers see, I decided to indent it to the right, so it would be come distinguished from my blog posts. Lastly, I decided to change the color of the text from gray to a dark cyan because I believe it compliments the blue nicely. Finally, for my blog post categories, I decided to number them, include the publication date, author alias, and my major and classification. I decided to include bullet points for this category because it was less casual compared to the navigation menu and did an effecient job of emphasizing each category. Although this is just the beginning of my blog design, overall, I am satisfied with the simple yet productive design layout of my blog.
