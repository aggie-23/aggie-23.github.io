For lab activity #10, I worked on three tasks to help add content and style to my GitHub. First, I included additional information to my About Me page, selected a theme for my blog, and finally re-organized the style of my navigation menu and blog post category set-up. Regarding the first thing on the list, I had already pre-written the content for my first blog post, which explained the on-campus jobs I've had since I was a freshman. Therefore, to transfer this information, I opened the saved About Me markdown file on my desktop and copied and pasted it into the About Me file on my blog through VSCode. I then committed the changes and pushed and pulled them onto my main repository. Next for my design process, I decided to choose from one of the pre-existing GitHub themes. Because I prefer simplicity when it comes to style, I selected the Cayman theme. Finally, regarding the navigation menu, I decided to remove the bullet points because it made the menu look too casual. Because it would be one of the first things that readers see, I also indented the navigation menu to the right, so it would spatially be distinguished from my blog post titles. Specifically, within the navigation menu, I added three different options for content. I included "About My Site," "My Favorite Classes," and "My Past Organizations" within the defaults.html file. Each option is a link leading users to a different page that is embedded within the < nav > tags. Lastly, I changed the color of the text in my navigation menu from gray to dark cyan because it compliments the blue nicely. Lastly, for my blog post categories, I decided to number them as well as include the publication date, my author username, and my major and classification. This time, I included bullet points for the blog post categories because they were less casual compared to the navigation menu. The bullet points also do an efficient job of emphasizing each of the categories listed. Although this is just the beginning of my blog design, overall, I am satisfied with the simple yet productive design layout.
