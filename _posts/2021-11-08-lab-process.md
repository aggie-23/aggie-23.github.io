For lab activity #10, I worked on three tasks to help add content and style to my GitHub. First, I added information to my About Me page, selected a theme for my blog, and finally re-organized the style of my navigation menu and blog post category set-up. Regrading the first thing on the last, I had already pre-written the content for my first post on this blog, explaining the on-campus jobs I've had since I was a freshman. Therefore, to re-access it and upload it onto my blog, I opened the saved About Me markdown file on my desktop and copied and pasted it into the About Me file on my blog through VSCode. I then committed the changes and pushed and pulled it onto my main repository. Next, for my design process, I decided to choose one of the pre-existing GitHub themes to add to my blog. Because I prefer simplicity when it comes to style, I chose the Cayman theme. Finally, regarding the navigating the menu, I decided to remove the bullet points because it made the menu look more casual. Because it would be one of the first thing that my readers see, I decided to remove it. Also, I indented the navigation menu to the right, so it would spatially be come distinguished from my blog post titles. Lastly, I decided to change the color of the text from gray to dark cyan because it compliments the blue nicely. Finally, for my blog post categories, I decided to number them as well as include the publication date, my author username, and my major and classification. This time, I decided to include bullet points for the blog post categories because I believe they was less casual compared to the navigation menu. The bullet points also do an effecient job of emphasizing each of the categories listed. Although this is just the beginning of my blog design, overall, I am satisfied with the simple yet productive design layout.
